## about
This program will help you manage keys / efficiently look at timed sites inside the game "Welcome To The Game 2" by Reflect Studios.
Currently only works on Windows, as I'm learning how to code with c++.
If you're ever lost in the program, type "help" for a list of commands.

## builds
I'll always upload the newest release to the [releases tab](https://github.com/Harbor811/wttg2-helper/releases).
